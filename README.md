It would be a good idea to write here things that need to be done in the future#



1) i will have to go to the diagnosis report from the patient with NA, because the 
pathologist said its not PAS. so this sample might have to be removed from the analysis 

Histology looked PAS to my point of view but this could be a coincidence 

2) adapting the metadata acordingly and re-run of the analysis

3) visualisation

4) writing functions
